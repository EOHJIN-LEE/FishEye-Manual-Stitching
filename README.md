# Computer-Vision---FishEyeManualSitching
Computer Vision - FishEyeManualSitching

Description
===========

This code is aimed at stitching images of the FishEye
----------------------------------------------
However, this code must be matched manually, unlike other projects.
---------------------------------------------
Because, in any image, we wanted to create a code that would allow us to match features point in the most challenging conditions.
-----------------------------------------
stitching has always made it possible in subway stations and places with many simple patterns.
---------------------------------------------------------------
In order to stitch up a difficult image, I thought that interaction with people was a solution.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And we've developed it so that you can do manual stitching in the video taken with a regular camera lens, not with fish eye lens.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use it the way you want.
